# Firebase Setup for User Profile

## Firestore Database Structure

The user profile page uses Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve user information. Here's the structure:

### Collection: `users`
Document ID: User's Firebase Auth UID

#### Fields:

```javascript
{
  // Personal Information
  "fullName": string,              // User's full name
  "email": string,                 // User's email address (from Auth)
  "phoneNumber": string,           // Phone number with country code
  "address": string,               // Full address
  
  // Travel Documents
  "passportNumber": string,        // Passport number
  "passportExpiration": string,    // Passport expiration date (MM/DD/YYYY)
  "visaNumber": string,            // Visa type or number
  "insuranceProvider": string,     // Travel insurance provider name
  
  // Additional Information
  "emergencyContact": string,      // Emergency contact information
  "preferredAirport": string,      // Preferred departure airport
  "preferredLanguages": string,    // Comma-separated list of languages
  
  // Security & Preferences
  "twoFactorEnabled": boolean,     // Two-factor authentication status
  "dataProcessingConsent": boolean,// User consent for data processing
  "profileImageUrl": string,       // URL to profile picture (nullable)
  
  // Metadata
  "createdAt": timestamp,          // Document creation timestamp
  "updatedAt": timestamp           // Last update timestamp
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Cloud Firestore

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **TravelEase**
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Create database**
5. Start in **test mode** for development (change to production rules later)
6. Choose a location close to your users (e.g., `asia-southeast1` for Philippines)

### 2. Security Rules (Development)

For development, use these rules (in Firestore Rules tab):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Security Rules (Production - More Secure)

For production, use stricter rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own document
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can create their own document on signup
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can update their own document, but not change email
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId
                    && request.resource.data.email == resource.data.email;
      
      // Only users can delete their own account
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### On Page Load:
1. The app checks if a user is logged in via Firebase Auth
2. It fetches the user's profile from Firestore using their UID
3. If no profile exists, it creates a new document with default values
4. Profile data is loaded into the text controllers for display/editing

### On Save:
1. User clicks "Save Information" button
2. App validates that user is still logged in
3. All form data is sent to Firestore via `update()` method
4. `updatedAt` timestamp is automatically set
5. Success/error message is shown to user

### On Delete Account:
1. User confirms account deletion in a dialog
2. User's Firestore document is deleted
3. User's Firebase Auth account is deleted
4. User is redirected to splash screen

## Testing

### Create Test Data:

1. Run the app and sign up a new user
2. The profile will be automatically created in Firestore
3. Navigate to My Profile and fill in the information
4. Click "Save Information"
5. Check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database to see the data

### Manual Test in Firebase Console:

You can manually create test documents:

1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Create collection: `users`
3. Add document with ID = a test user's Auth UID
4. Add fields as shown in the structure above
5. Run the app and log in with that user

## Important Notes

- **Email is read-only**: Email comes from Firebase Auth and should not be changed in Firestore
- **Profile images**: Image URLs are stored, but upload functionality needs to be implemented with Firebase Storage
- **Data validation**: Add validation rules in both client (Flutter) and server (Firestore Rules)
- **Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection laws (GDPR, PDPA, etc.)
- **Backup**: Enable automatic backups in Firebase Console for production

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement profile image upload with Firebase Storage
- [ ] Add form validation before saving
- [ ] Implement password change with Firebase Auth
- [ ] Add real-time listeners for profile updates
- [ ] Create indexes for efficient queries (if needed)
- [ ] Implement data export for user privacy compliance
