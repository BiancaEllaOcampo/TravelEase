# Firebase Integration Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. **User Signup (`user_signup.dart`)**

#### Added Imports:
```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
```

#### Modified `_performFirebaseSignup()` Method:
- **Creates Firestore user profile automatically** when a new user signs up
- Sets the user's full name (first + last) in both Auth and Firestore
- Initializes all profile fields with empty values
- Sets timestamps for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
- Better error handling with descriptive messages

#### Firestore Document Created on Signup:
```javascript
users/{userId} = {
  fullName: "First Last",           // From signup form
  email: "user@email.com",          // From signup form
  phoneNumber: "",                  // Empty, to be filled in profile
  address: "",                      // Empty
  passportNumber: "",               // Empty
  passportExpiration: "",           // Empty
  visaNumber: "",                   // Empty
  insuranceProvider: "",            // Empty
  emergencyContact: "",             // Empty
  preferredAirport: "",             // Empty
  preferredLanguages: "",           // Empty
  twoFactorEnabled: false,          // Default
  dataProcessingConsent: false,     // Default
  profileImageUrl: null,            // Default
  createdAt: [server timestamp],    // Automatic
  updatedAt: [server timestamp]     // Automatic
}
```

### 2. **User Login (`user_login.dart`)**

#### Added Imports:
```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
```

#### Modified `_performFirebaseLogin()` Method:
- **Checks if Firestore profile exists** after successful login
- **Auto-creates profile** if user signed up before Firestore integration was added
- Uses existing Firebase Auth data (displayName, email) when creating retroactive profiles
- Added `invalid-credential` error handling for better UX
- Better error messages with detailed information

#### Benefits:
- Backwards compatible with users created before this update
- Ensures every logged-in user has a Firestore profile
- No manual database setup required

---

### 3. **User Profile (`user_profile.dart`)** - Already Updated Earlier

- Loads user data from Firestore on page load
- Saves all profile changes to Firestore
- Handles account deletion (both Auth and Firestore)
- Shows loading states during operations
- Full error handling

---

## Complete User Flow

### New User Signs Up:
1. User fills signup form (first name, last name, email, password)
2. Firebase Auth account is created
3. **Firestore profile is automatically created** âœ…
4. User is redirected to homepage
5. User can go to "My Profile" and fill in additional details
6. Profile data is saved to Firestore

### Existing User Logs In:
1. User enters email and password
2. Firebase Auth validates credentials
3. **App checks if Firestore profile exists**
4. If no profile exists, **creates one automatically** âœ…
5. User is redirected to homepage
6. User's profile data loads from Firestore when they visit "My Profile"

### User Updates Profile:
1. User navigates to "My Profile" from menu
2. **Profile data loads from Firestore** (or empty if first time)
3. User edits fields (phone, address, passport, etc.)
4. User clicks "Save Information"
5. **All data is saved to Firestore** âœ…
6. Success message is shown

### User Deletes Account:
1. User clicks "Delete Account" in profile
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed:
   - **Firestore profile is deleted** âœ…
   - **Firebase Auth account is deleted** âœ…
   - User is redirected to splash screen

## Testing Checklist

### Test New User Signup:
- [ ] Run app: `flutter run`
- [ ] Click "Create an Account" on splash screen
- [ ] Fill in all fields and submit
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ `users` collection
- [ ] Verify new document exists with user's UID
- [ ] Verify `fullName` and `email` are populated
- [ ] Verify all other fields are empty strings
- [ ] Verify timestamps are set

### Test Existing User Login:
- [ ] Log in with existing account
- [ ] Check if profile loads correctly in "My Profile"
- [ ] If user existed before update, verify profile was auto-created

### Test Profile Update:
- [ ] Navigate to "My Profile"
- [ ] Fill in fields (phone, address, passport, etc.)
- [ ] Click "Save Information"
- [ ] Check Firebase Console to verify data was saved
- [ ] Refresh app and verify data persists

### Test Account Deletion:
- [ ] Go to "My Profile"
- [ ] Click "Delete Account"
- [ ] Confirm deletion
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ Authentication (user should be gone)
- [ ] Check Firebase Console â†’ Firestore (user document should be gone)
- [ ] Verify app redirects to splash screen

## Firebase Console Setup Reminder

### Required Steps:

1. **Enable Cloud Firestore**
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Click "Firestore Database"
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose a location (e.g., `asia-southeast1` for Philippines)
   - Start in **Test Mode** for development

2. **Set Security Rules**
   - Click "Rules" tab in Firestore
   - Replace with:
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Click "Publish"

3. **Test the Integration**
   - Run your Flutter app
   - Sign up a new user
   - Check Firestore Console to see the new document

---

## Security Features

âœ… **User Isolation**: Users can only read/write their own data  
âœ… **Authentication Required**: All Firestore operations require Firebase Auth  
âœ… **Auto-cleanup**: Deleting account removes both Auth and Firestore data  
âœ… **Backwards Compatible**: Existing users get profiles created on login  
âœ… **Error Handling**: All operations have try-catch with user feedback  
âœ… **Data Validation**: Fields are trimmed and validated before saving  

---

## Important Notes

- **Profile images**: URLs are stored, but upload functionality needs Firebase Storage
- **Email changes**: Email is controlled by Firebase Auth, not Firestore
- **Password changes**: Use Firebase Auth password reset (not yet implemented in profile)
- **2FA**: Toggle is saved but actual implementation needed
- **Data consent**: Stored but legal compliance flow needed
- **Production**: Change Firestore rules to production mode before launch

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Add profile image upload with Firebase Storage
- [ ] Implement password change functionality
- [ ] Add email verification requirement
- [ ] Implement actual 2FA with Firebase
- [ ] Add form validation for dates, phone numbers
- [ ] Add date pickers for expiration dates
- [ ] Add country/airport selection dropdowns
- [ ] Implement data export for GDPR compliance
- [ ] Add profile completion progress indicator
- [ ] Add profile photo cropping/resizing

## File Changes Summary

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `user_signup.dart` | âœ… Added Firestore profile creation on signup |
| `user_login.dart` | âœ… Added profile existence check and auto-creation |
| `user_profile.dart` | âœ… Full Firestore integration (load/save/delete) |
| `pubspec.yaml` | âœ… Added `cloud_firestore` dependency |
| `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` | âœ… Documentation for Firestore setup |

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
- **Cause**: Firestore security rules not set up
- **Fix**: Set up rules in Firebase Console (see above)

### "Document doesn't exist" on Profile Page
- **Cause**: User signed up before Firestore integration
- **Fix**: User just needs to log in again (profile auto-created)

### "Network Error" / "Timeout"
- **Cause**: Firestore not enabled or network issues
- **Fix**: Check Firebase Console and internet connection

### Profile Data Not Saving
- **Cause**: User not authenticated or rules blocking
- **Fix**: Check if user is logged in, verify security rules
